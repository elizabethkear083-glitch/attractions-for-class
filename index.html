        <h1>Activities in the Perimiter</h1>
        <main>These destinations are within the perimiter of Atlanta, which is usually defined by being within
            the loop of highway 285. Most of these could be visited within a single day
        </main>

            <li><a href="https://puppet.org/ "> Center for Puppetry Arts</a></li>
        </ol>
         Many activities within the perimeter can be done with a <a href="https://www.citypass.com/atlanta ">City Pass</a>, 
            which is a one time bundle that has admission to most of the major activities within Georgia.
